# Hierarchical Clustering on Iris Data

Motivation, references, and the bulk of explanation of methods is (will eventually be) included in the report in the `report` directory, which contains both the pdf and tex files.

### Running the program

Only the .ipynb file has been uploaded (hopefully the .py will be eventually as well to be command line runnable). Python code written with Anaconda3 (using Python 3.7.3). The last cell of the notebook can be customized to run whatever combination of settings to cluster the iris data.

Note that graphs are not saved to images and only output, so running the notebook is recommended to view graphs.
